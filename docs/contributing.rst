Contributor guide
=================

Thanks for considering contributing to fedora-messaging, we really appreciate it!

Quickstart
==========

1. Look for an `existing issue
   <https://github.com/fedora-infra/fedora-messaging/issues>`_ about the bug or
   feature you're interested in. If you can't find an existing issue, create a
   `new one <https://github.com/fedora-infra/fedora-messaging/issues/new>`_.

2. Fork the `repository on GitHub
   <https://github.com/fedora-infra/fedora-messaging>`_.

3. Fix the bug or add the feature, and then write one or more tests which show
   the bug is fixed or the feature works.

4. Add a `news fragment <#release-notes>`_ with a summary of the change to
   include in the upcoming release notes.

5. Submit a pull request and wait for a maintainer to review it.

More detailed guidelines to help ensure your submission goes smoothly are
below.

.. note:: If you do not wish to use GitHub, please send patches to
          infrastructure@lists.fedoraproject.org.


Python Support
==============
fedora-messaging supports Python 3.6 or greater. This is automatically enforced
by the continuous integration (CI) suite.


Code Style
==========
We follow the `PEP8 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`_ style guide
for Python. This is automatically enforced by the CI suite.

We are using `Black <https://github.com/ambv/black>` to automatically format
the source code. It is also checked in CI. The Black webpage contains
instructions to configure your editor to run it on the files you edit.

We use `pre-commit <https://pre-commit.com/>`_ to run a set of linters and formatters upon commit.
To setup to hook for your repo clone, install pre-commit and run ``pre-commit install``.


Tests
=====
The test suites can be run using `tox <http://tox.readthedocs.io/>`_ by simply
running ``tox`` from the repository root. All code must have test coverage or
be explicitly marked as not covered using the ``# no-qa`` comment. This should
only be done if there is a good reason to not write tests.

Your pull request should contain tests for your new feature or bug fix. If
you're not certain how to write tests, we will be happy to help you.


Release notes
=============
To add entries to the release notes, run ``towncrier create <source.type>`` to
create a news fragment file in the ``news`` directory, where ``type`` is one of:

* ``feature``: for new features
* ``bug``: for bug fixes
* ``api``: for API changes
* ``dev``: for development-related changes
* ``docs``: for documentation changes
* ``author``: for contributor names
* ``other``: for other changes

And where the ``source`` part of the filename is:

* ``42`` when the change is described in issue ``42``
* ``PR42`` when the change has been implemented in pull request ``42``, and
  there is no associated issue
* ``Cabcdef`` when the change has been implemented in changeset ``abcdef``, and
  there is no associated issue or pull request.
* ``username`` for contributors (``author`` extention). It should be the
  username part of their commits' email address.

For example,

::

    towncrier create PR42.feature

The contents of the news fragment must be written in RST format.
See the `towncrier documentation for more information
<https://github.com/twisted/towncrier>`_.

A preview of the release notes can be generated with ``towncrier --draft``.

Releasing
=========
When cutting a new release, follow these steps:

* update the version in ``fedora_messaging/__init__.py``
* add missing authors to the release notes fragments by changing to the ``news``
  directory and running the ``get-authors.py`` script, but check for duplicates
  and errors
* generate the changelog by running ``towncrier``
* adjust the release notes in ``docs/changelog.rst``
* generate the docs with ``tox -e docs`` and check them in ``docs/_build/html``
* change the ``Development Status`` classifier in ``setup.py`` if necessary
* commit the changes
* push the commit to the upstream Github repository (via a PR or not).
* change to the stable branch and merge the ``develop`` branch
* run the checks with ``tox`` one last time to be sure
* tag the commit with ``-s`` to generate a signed tag
* push the commit to the upstream Github repository with ``git push`` and the
  new tag with ``git push --tags``
* generate a tarball and push to PyPI with the commands:

::

    python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
    twine upload -s dist/*

* create `the release on GitHub <https://github.com/fedora-infra/fedora-messaging/tags>`_
  and copy the release notes in there
* deploy and announce
