API Changes
-----------

* ``fedora_messaging.message.Message.summary`` is now a property rather than
  a method.


v1.0.0a1
========

The initial alpha release for fedora-messaging v1.0.0. The API is not expected
to change significantly between this release and the final v1.0.0 release, but
it may do so if serious flaws are discovered in it.
