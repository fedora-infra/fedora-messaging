v1.0.0b1
========

API Changes
-----------

* :data:`fedora_messaging.message.Message.summary` is now a property rather than
  a method (`#25 <https://github.com/fedora-infra/fedora-messaging/pull/25>`_).

* The non-functional ``--amqp-url`` parameter has been removed from the CLI
  (`#49 <https://github.com/fedora-infra/fedora-messaging/pull/49>`_).


Features
--------

* Configuration parsing failures now produce point to the line and column of
  the parsing error (`#21
  <https://github.com/fedora-infra/fedora-messaging/pull/21>`_).

* :class:`fedora_messaging.message.Message` now come with a set of standard accessors
  (`#32 <https://github.com/fedora-infra/fedora-messaging/pull/32>`_).

* Consumers can now specify whether a message should be re-queued when halting
  (`#44 <https://github.com/fedora-infra/fedora-messaging/pull/44>`_).

* An example consumer that prints to standard output now ships with
  fedora-messaging. It can be used by running ``fedora-messaging consume
  --callback="fedora_messaging.example:printer"``
  (`#40 <https://github.com/fedora-infra/fedora-messaging/pull/40>`_).

* :class:`fedora_messaging.message.Message` now have a ``severity`` associated with them
  (`#48 <https://github.com/fedora-infra/fedora-messaging/pull/48>`_).

Bug Fixes
---------

* Fix an issue where invalid or missing configuration files resulted in a
  traceback rather than a formatted error message from the CLI (`#21
  <https://github.com/fedora-infra/fedora-messaging/pull/21>`_).

* Client authentication with x509 now works with both the synchronous API and
  the Twisted API (
  `#29 <https://github.com/fedora-infra/fedora-messaging/pull/29>`_,
  `#35 <https://github.com/fedora-infra/fedora-messaging/pull/35>`_).

* :func:`fedora_messaging.api.publish` no longer raises a
  :class:`pika.exceptions.ChannelClosed` exception. Instead, it raises a
  :class:`fedora_messaging.exceptions.ConnectionException`
  (`#31 <https://github.com/fedora-infra/fedora-messaging/pull/31>`_).

* :func:`fedora_messaging.api.consume` is now documented to raise a :class:`ValueError`
  when the callback isn't callable
  (`#47 <https://github.com/fedora-infra/fedora-messaging/pull/47>`_).


Development Features
--------------------

* The fedora-messaging code base is now compliant with the `Black
  <https://github.com/ambv/black>`_ Python formatter and this is enforced with
  continuous integration.

* Test coverage is moving up and to the right.

v1.0.0a1
========

The initial alpha release for fedora-messaging v1.0.0. The API is not expected
to change significantly between this release and the final v1.0.0 release, but
it may do so if serious flaws are discovered in it.
