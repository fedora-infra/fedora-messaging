fedora-messaging can be configured with the
``/etc/fedora-messaging/config.toml`` file or by setting the
``FEDORA_MESSAGING_CONF`` environment variable to the path of the configuration
file.

Each configuration option has a default value.

.. contents:: Table of Configuration Options
    :local:

A complete example TOML configuration:

.. literalinclude:: ../config.toml.example


Generic Options
===============

These options apply to both consumers and publishers.

.. _conf-amqp-url:

amqp_url
--------
The AMQP broker to connect to. This URL should be in the format described by
the :class:`pika.connection.URLParameters` documentation. This defaults to
``'amqp://?connection_attempts=3&retry_delay=5``.

.. note:: When using the Twisted consumer API, which the CLI does by default,
          any connection-related setting won't apply as Twisted manages the
          TCP/TLS connection.


.. _conf-passive-declares:

passive_declares
----------------
A boolean to specify if queues and exchanges should be declared passively (i.e
checked, but not actually created on the server). Defaults to ``False``.


.. _conf-tls:

tls
---
A dictionary of the TLS settings to use when connecting to the AMQP broker. The
default is::

    {
        'ca_cert': '/etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.crt',
        'keyfile': None,
        'certfile': None,
    }

The value of ``ca_cert`` should be the path to a bundle of CA certificates used
to validate the certificate presented by the server. The 'keyfile' and
'certfile' values should be to the client key and client certificate to use
when authenticating with the broker.

.. note:: The broker URL must use the ``amqps`` scheme. It is also possible to
          provide these setting via the ``amqp_url`` setting using a URL-encoded
          JSON object. This setting is provided as a convenient way to avoid that.


.. _conf-client-properties:

client_properties
-----------------
A dictionary that describes the client to the AMQP broker. This makes it easy
to identify the application using a connection. The dictionary can contain
arbitrary string keys and values. The default is::

    {
        'app': 'Unknown',
        'product': 'Fedora Messaging with Pika',
        'information': 'https://fedora-messaging.readthedocs.io/en/stable/',
        'version': 'fedora_messaging-<version> with pika-<version>',
    }

Apps should set the ``app`` along with any additional keys they feel will help
administrators when debugging application connections. Do not use the
``product``, ``information``, and ``version`` keys as these will be set
automatically.

.. _conf-exchanges:

exchanges
---------
A dictionary of exchanges that should be present in the broker. Each key should
be an exchange name, and the value should be a dictionary with the exchange's
configuration.  Options are:

* ``type`` - the type of exchange to create.

* ``durable`` - whether or not the exchange should survive a broker restart.

* ``auto_delete`` - whether or not the exchange should be deleted once no queues
  are bound to it.

* ``arguments`` - dictionary of arbitrary keyword arguments for the exchange,
  which depends on the broker in use and its extensions.

For example::

    {
        'my_exchange': {
            'type': 'fanout',
            'durable': True,
            'auto_delete': False,
            'arguments': {},
        },
    }

The default is to ensure the 'amq.topic' topic exchange exists which should be
sufficient for most use cases.

.. _conf-log-config:

log_config
----------
A dictionary describing the logging configuration to use, in a format accepted
by :func:`logging.config.dictConfig`.


Publisher Options
=================

The following configuration options are publisher-related.

.. _conf-publish-exchange:

publish_exchange
----------------
A string that identifies the exchange to publish to. The default is
``amq.topic``.


.. _conf-topic-prefix:

topic_prefix
------------
A string that will be prepended to topics on sent messages.
This is useful to migrate from fedmsg, but should not be used otherwise.
The default is an empty string.

.. _sub-config:

Consumer Options
================

The following configuration options are consumer-related.

.. _conf-queues:

queues
------
A dictionary of queues that should be present in the broker. Each key should be
a queue name, and the value should be a dictionary with the queue's configuration.
Options are:

* ``durable`` - whether or not the queue should survive a broker restart. This is
  set to ``False`` for the default queue.

* ``auto_delete`` - whether or not the queue should be deleted once the
  consumer disconnects. This is set to ``True`` for the default queue.

* ``exclusive`` - whether or not the queue is exclusive to the current
  connection. This is set to ``False`` for the default queue.

* ``arguments`` - dictionary of arbitrary keyword arguments for the queue, which
  depends on the broker in use and its extensions. This is set to ``{}`` for the
  default queue

For example::

    {
        'my_queue': {
            'durable': True,
            'auto_delete': True,
            'exclusive': False,
            'arguments': {},
        },
    }


.. _conf-bindings:

bindings
--------
A list of dictionaries that define queue bindings to exchanges that consumers
will subscribe to. The ``queue`` key is the queue's name. The ``exchange`` key
should be the exchange name and the ``routing_keys`` key should be a list of
routing keys. For example::

    [
        {
            'queue': 'my_queue',
            'exchange': 'amq.topic',
            'routing_keys': ['topic1', 'topic2.#'],
        },
    ]

This would create two bindings for the ``my_queue`` queue, both to the
``amq.topic`` exchange. Consumers will consume from both queues.

.. _conf-callback:

callback
--------
The Python path of the callback. This should be in the format
``<module>:<object>``. For example, if the callback was called "my_callback"
and was located in the "my_module" module of the "my_package" package, the path
would be defined as ``my_package.my_module:my_callback``. The default is None.

Consult the :ref:`consumers` documentation for details on implementing a
callback.

.. _conf-consumer-config:

consumer_config
---------------
A dictionary for the consumer to use as configuration. The consumer should
access this key in its callback for any configuration it needs. Defaults to
an empty dictionary. If, for example, this dictionary contains the
``print_messages`` key, the callback can access this configuration with::

    from fedora_messaging import config

    def callback(message):
        if config.conf["consumer_config"]["print_messages"]:
            print(message)


.. _conf-qos:

qos
---
The quality of service settings to use for consumers. This setting is a
dictionary with two keys. ``prefetch_count`` specifies the number of messages
to pre-fetch from the server. Pre-fetching messages improves performance by
reducing the amount of back-and-forth between client and server. The downside
is if the consumer encounters an unexpected problem, messages won't be returned
to the queue and sent to a different consumer until the consumer times out.
``prefetch_size`` limits the size of pre-fetched messages (in bytes), with 0
meaning there is no limit. The default settings are::

    {
        'prefetch_count': 10,
        'prefetch_size': 0,
    }
