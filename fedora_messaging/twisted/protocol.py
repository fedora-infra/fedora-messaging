"""
The core Twisted interface, a protocol represent a specific connection to the
AMQP broker.

The :class:`.FedoraMessagingProtocolV2` has replaced the deprecated
:class:`.FedoraMessagingProtocolV2`. This class inherits the
:class:`pika.adapters.twisted_connection.TwistedProtocolConnection` class and
adds a few additional methods.

When combined with the :class:`fedora_messaging.twisted.factory.FedoraMessagingFactory`
class, it's easy to create AMQP consumers that last across connections.

        The loop that reads from the message queue and calls the consumer callback

        Serialized Processing
        ---------------------
        This loop processes messages serially. This is because a second
        ``queue_object.get()`` operation can only occur after the Deferred from
        ``self._on_message`` completes. Thus, we can be sure that callbacks
        never run concurrently in two different threads.

        This is done rather than saturating the Twisted thread pool as the
        documentation for callbacks (in fedmsg and here) has never indicated
        that they are not thread-safe. In the future we can add a flag for users
        who are confident in their ability to write thread-safe code.


        Gracefully Halting
        ------------------
        This is a loop that only exits when the consumer._running variable is
        set to False. The call to cancel will set this to false, as will the
        call to :meth:`pauseProducing`. These calls will then wait for the
        Deferred from this function to call back in order to ensure the message
        finishes processing.

        The Deferred object only completes when this method returns, so we need
        to periodically check the status of consumer._running. That's why
        there's a short timeout on the call to ``queue_object.get``.
