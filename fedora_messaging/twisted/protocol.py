The core Twisted interface, a protocol represent a specific connection to the
AMQP broker.

The :class:`.FedoraMessagingProtocolV2` inherits the
:class:`pika.adapters.twisted_connection.TwistedProtocolConnection` class and
adds a few additional methods.

When combined with the :class:`fedora_messaging.twisted.factory.FedoraMessagingFactoryV2`
class, it's easy to create AMQP consumers that last across connections.

For an overview of Twisted clients, see the `Twisted client documentation
