"""
The core Twisted interface, a protocol represent a specific connection to the
AMQP broker. When automatic reconnecting is required, the
:class:`fedora_messaging.twisted.factory.FedoraMessagingFactory` class should
be used to produce configured instances of :class:`.FedoraMessagingProtocol`.

:class:`.FedoraMessagingProtocol` is based on pika's Twisted Protocol. It
implements message schema validation when publishing and subscribing, as well
as a few convenience methods for declaring multiple objects at once.

For an overview of Twisted clients, see the `Twisted client documentation
<https://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/core/howto/clients.html#protocol>`_.

            bindings (list of dict): A list of binding definitions. Each dictionary
                must contain the "queue" key whose value is the name of the queue
                to create the binding on, as well as the "exchange" key whose value
                should be the name of the exchange to bind to. Additional acceptable
                keys are any keyword arguments accepted by
                :meth:`pika.channel.Channel.queue_bind`.

        Raises:
            NoFreeChannels: If there are no available channels on this connection.
                If this occurs, you can either reduce the number of consumers on this
                connection or create an additional connection.
            BadDeclaration: If a binding could not be declared. This can occur if the
                queue or exchange don't exist, or if they do, but the current user does
                not have permissions to create bindings.
