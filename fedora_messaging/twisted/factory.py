A Twisted Factory for creating and configuring instances of the
:class:`.FedoraMessagingProtocol`.

A factory is used to implement automatic re-connections by producing protocol
instances (connections) on demand. Twisted uses factories for its services APIs.

See the `Twisted client
<https://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/core/howto/clients.html#clientfactory>`_
documentation for more information.
